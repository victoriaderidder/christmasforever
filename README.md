This Christmas-themed text-based adventure is a continuation of my [2022 Christmas adventure](https://victoriaderidder.github.io/christmas2022/), which in turn is a continuation of my [2021 Christmas challege](https://victoriaderidder.github.io/achristmaschallenge/). But if you're in a hurry, don't worry! This adventure can stand alone. Just start with the Thanksgiving gift and it will teach you all the backstory you need to know.

This adventure was designed to be played on three separate days: Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and Christmas. Riddles begin on Christmas Eve and continue into Christmas.

If you're stuck, no need to panic! You can type 'skip' into any text box to move forward. However, I recommend giving it your best shot first.

Good luck!

## Development

### If `npm start` fails with `EMFILE: too many open files`

On macOS, `react-scripts start` can hit the OS open-file limit while bundling many static assets (e.g. mp3s).

Run `npm run start:mac`.
