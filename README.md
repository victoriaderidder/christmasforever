This is the home of my yearly Christmas adventure series, which began in 2020. But if you're in a hurry, don't worry — each year's adventure can stand alone.

If you're stuck, no need to panic! You can type 'skip' into any text box to move forward. However, I recommend giving it your best shot first.

You will have the best experience playing these adventures on a laptop with sound on. [Click here to play.](https://victoriaderidder.github.io/christmasforever/)

Good luck!
